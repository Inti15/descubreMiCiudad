          One day the Aztec people began a war with the neighboring town. For Popoca this was an opportunity
          to win the rigth to ask for Mixtli's hand. During Popoca absence, Axoxco try to seduce  the young  and beautiful princess. However, Mixtli remained
          faithful to her beloved Popoca and rejected Axoxco's sweet words and gifts.
          Axoxco figured a cruel way to get the princess's love and patiently waited for the war to end.
          He paid the messengers to say that Popoca had died in battle. Mixtli felt her heart was broken whe she heard the news. For days she cried over the supposed death
          of her beloved. She abandoned herself to her sadness and her body became weak, she lost her will to live and finally died.
          When Popoca found the princess dead, he was beyond control. His wailing reached the neighboring mountains.
          In the midst of his pain, he delicately took his beautiful beloved in his arms and headed for the mountains.
          The gods were so moved by this beautiful example of love that they wanted to reward Popoca's faithful tenderness. They decided that they should never be seoparated. They transformed them into rocks,
          so that they could be together for all eternity.

        <p class="text-p leyenda1">"Oh, my children!" This was the terrorizing scream that was heard in the
          streets of Mexico City after ten o'clock at nigth. The Weeping Woman, as this strange ghost was called,
          caused fear and panic among the people of New Spain. She appeared at a distance wearing a white gown that seemed to float in the air, her face was covered
          by a veil that was wrapped around her body by the cool nocturnal brezze.
          In this slow manner she crossed the city streets and plazas raising her hands desperatly and shouting her desperate cry, "Oh , my children!"
          That desperate cry came out of the darkness and then disappeared with terrible distant echoes, to later reappear in some other part of the city.

        <p class="text-p leyenda2">After the Independence, all noble titles were abolished, but the Counts of Orizaba
          remained living in the House of Tiles. On December 4, 1828, the house was looted by an angry mob. An officer,
          angry because he was no permitted to romance a young woman of the family, broke into the House of Tiles.
          He entered in the exact moment that the ex-Count Andres Diego de Peredo was coming down the stairs. He attacked the ex-count viciously
          whit a dagger, killing him instantly. The assassin was sentenced and executed, but this didn't erase the sad memories in this majestic house.
          The house was adorned with funeral ornaments and its windows and doors closed.
